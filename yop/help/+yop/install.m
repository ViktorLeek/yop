function install
% YOP.INSTALL
%   To use Yop you need to add Yop and Casadi to your Matlab path. 
% 
%   Either add Yop permanently by selecting 'set path' from Matlab's HOME 
%   tab, or right click on the Yop folder and move the cursor to 
%   'Add to Path' and from the drop down menu select 
%   'Selected Folders and Subfolders'.
% 
%   You also need to add CasADi to your path. CasADi can be downloaded from
%   https://web.casadi.org/get/ 
%   The procedure of adding it to the path is the same as that of Yop, with
%   the obvious difference that the downloaded CasADi folder should be
%   selected.
% 
%   Once the two above steps are completed a good way to get started is by
%   testing some of the examples. Run 'help yop.getting_started' for more
%   info.
